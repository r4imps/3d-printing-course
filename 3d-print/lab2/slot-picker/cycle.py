"""cycle.py — the Lab 2 glass cycle: input -> workstation -> output, as a list of robot actions.

Each role (input, workstation, output) is a holder from layout.json. A holder keeps its taught
points in "teach": dx/dy (offset of the pocket from the cell centre, mm) and pick_z / place_z.
The offset belongs to the holder, not to the cell, so a holder moved to another cell reuses it:
that is the 42 mm question of the refit test.

Glass n (1-based) is taken from the n-th input cell and put into the n-th output cell; the
workstation always uses layout["cycle"]["workstation_cell"].

With layout["cycle"]["workstation_step"] false (the default for now) the workstation is skipped:
one glass goes straight from the input tray to the output tray (transfer test).
